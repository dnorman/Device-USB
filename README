Device-USB

This module provides a relatively complete Perl wrapper on the libusb
library. Using this module provides an object-oriented interface to any 
installed USB devices.

Obviously, the module requires a copy of the libusb library compiled for the
target system. The module also requires a C compiler compatible with the
Perl installation, because it uses the Inline::C module to create the 
interface to libusb.

TODO

The current version of the library does not fully support 'get_descriptor'.
This method currently returns a binary string containing the data, the code
to create a reasonable data structure has not yet been written.

The device objects also do not contain pointers back to their busses at this
time. This feature will be added once I am certain that it will not leak
memory.
