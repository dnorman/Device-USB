NAME
    Device::USB - perl api to libusb

SYNOPSIS
      use Device::USB;

      my $list = List();

      # dump $list with Data::Dumper for details

DESCRIPTION
    This module will allow custom usb drivers to be written in perl.
    Currently it only lists the devices.

NOTES
    Expect the interface to change. You must have libusb v0.1.8 installed
    first.

TODO
    Documentation ;)
